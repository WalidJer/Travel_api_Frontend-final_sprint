## Running Locally

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WalidJer/Travel_api_Frontend-final_sprint.git
cd Travel_api_Frontend-final_sprint
```
2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```
3. **Start the server**

```bash
npm start
```

The app will run on http://localhost:3000.

### Backend API
Make sure the Spring Boot backend is running on the correct port (default http://localhost:8080). All requests are handled through axios in the /services directory.

## AWS Deployment
The frontend can be deployed to AWS S3 for static website hosting.
It will connect to the backend API hosted on AWS EC2, which communicates with AWS RDS MySQL.

### 1. Update Axios Base URLs
In each file inside /src/services, replace the local backend URL:

```
// Before (local development)
const API_URL = "http://localhost:8080/cities";

// After (production on AWS)
const API_URL = "http://<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>:8080/cities";
Tip: You can store the base URL in a single config file to avoid updating multiple places.
```

### 2. Build for Production
```
npm run build
```
This creates a build/ OR dist/ folder containing static HTML, CSS, and JS files.

### 3. Upload to S3
- Create an S3 bucket with a unique name.

- Enable Static Website Hosting in the bucket properties.

- Upload all files from the dist/ folder.

- Set public access permissions for the files.

- Update CORS configuration in S3 to allow requests from your EC2 domain.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::travel-app-frontend-walid/*"
    }
  ]
}
```
### 4.  Test the Live Application
Visit the S3 static site URL (or custom domain if configured).

Perform CRUD actions â€” they should reflect instantly in the RDS database.
